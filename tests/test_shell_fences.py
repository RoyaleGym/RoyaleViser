"""Would a reader's shell actually run the commands on this repo's pages?

WHY THIS EXISTS
    On 2026-09-22 the published install block ran in NO shell a newcomer would use, and
    had not since the repos were split. Four readers hit it from four entry points. The
    shapes, each confirmed on a real machine rather than argued: ``&&`` is a parse error
    in Windows PowerShell 5.1 before anything executes; a trailing ``#`` comment is not a
    comment in ``cmd``, so ``python -m venv .venv  # Python 3.12`` silently creates four
    directories and no environment; and a Windows backslash path inside a ```bash fence
    loses its backslashes.

    The second is the dangerous one, because it does not fail. The reader gets no error
    and no working venv.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
    Only those shapes, on the pages a newcomer actually lands on. It does not read the
    commands and cannot tell you the instructions are correct: the real check is a person
    running the recipe verbatim in PowerShell from an empty folder, which is how this was
    found. This is the guard that stops it coming back through ordinary editing.

    The checker is ``tests/_shell_fences.py``, a vendored copy kept byte-identical to the
    original so the four public repos' copies can be diffed. Its own ``--selftest`` plants
    all four shapes plus three that must NOT fire, and that self-test is run here too: a
    guard whose self-test is never run is a guard nobody has seen work.

THE READER-PAGE CHECK IS NOT WIRED HERE YET, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS PARAGRAPH
    ``README.md`` had 17 of these blocks, the most of the four repos. The check below was
    deliberately left unwired until the prose repair landed, because a guard pointed at a
    page another session is mid-edit on is a red suite for everyone in the tree, and a
    guard that cries wolf is one somebody switches off. The repair is ``90eb5a1``. The
    guard reported 17 before it and 0 after, which is the evidence for both of them.

A GUARD WITH FALSE POSITIVES IS ONE SOMEBODY SWITCHES OFF
    The checker's first version demanded a named shell near EVERY block rather than once
    per page, so it flagged the two pages that had just been fixed. That was corrected
    before it shipped. If this ever goes red on a page a person has just verified by
    hand, suspect the guard before the page.
